# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub Repository. This is where you can follow me on my journey to become a Data Scientist. 

Given that Data Science is a multi-disciplinary profession, I'll be posting not only full projects, but projects that tackle various aspects of the Data Science pipeline

## data_tools
A folder for any code I write that accomplishes a small task that I might need to refer to in the future like geocoding and using python to add functionality to tools like Alteryx or Tableau

## Regression_Models
A folder for any projects I do that rely entirely or primarily on regression models.
