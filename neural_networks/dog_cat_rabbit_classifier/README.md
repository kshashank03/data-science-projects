# Overview
This project is an expansion to a neural network I built to differentiate cats and dogs from one another. My girlfriend has a rabbit so I decided to take a whack at training a neural network to recognize rabbits as well. 

# Process
Through a course in Data Science by the team at SUper Data Science, I already had access to 5000 images of cats and dogs each. The first challenge was finding images of rabbits to train my network on. I had only found out about the Google Open Images API after I had gathered my images otherwise I would have used that. Not knowing better I set out to scrape the images off of Google Images. Modifying a script I found to scrape Google Images using Selenium and Chrome, i was able to pull all 5000 images I needed.
